## Reporting bugs and opening issues

If you'd like a report a bug or open an issue then please:

**Check if there is an existing issue.** If that is the case, then please provide more information or give it a üëç.

When submitting an issue please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens.

If you can include screenshots, trace data or any additional context, it could be quite helpful.
